# CodeGenerator
A project to generate .NET objects based on database (or other kind) of models using the Razor view engine.

Work in progress, still needs polishing.

Currently:
- Generates .NET classes for each table in MySql
- Generates .NET interface class for each table in MySql
- Generates .NET repository class for each table in MySql

Example use is in the CodeGenerator.Tests project.
